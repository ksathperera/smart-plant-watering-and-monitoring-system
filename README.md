<h1>Smart Plant Watering & Health Monitoring System</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

With the challenges brought by rapid urbanization and climate change, maintaining healthy plants has become more difficult. Overwatering or underwatering leads to plant stress, water wastage, and reduced yield. Manual methods often lack efficiency and sustainability.

The Smart Plant Watering & Health Monitoring System provides a smart, automated solution by integrating IoT and machine learning. It uses environmental sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, processes the collected data through an ESP32 microcontroller, and stores it in a MongoDB cloud database. A machine learning model predicts optimal watering times, reducing manual intervention and promoting sustainable gardening and farming practices.

With real-time monitoring through a Node-RED dashboard, predictive analytics, and remote control capability, the system ensures healthier plants, conserves water, and makes smart agriculture accessible.

<h2>Features</h2>
    • Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity <br>
    • Cloud-based data storage (MongoDB) <br>
    • Predictive watering using Machine Learning (Linear Regression)<br>
    • Automated irrigation system<br>
    • Interactive visualization dashboard (Node-RED)<br>
    • Automated alerts for abnormal environmental conditions<br>
    • Remote control of watering through web interface<br><br>
